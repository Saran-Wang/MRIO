# MRIO Project

## Overview
This project focuses on **Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) modeling** to analyze trade-related **PM2.5 health impacts** and economic externalities. It integrates computational and data science techniques to improve large-scale air quality modeling and policy evaluation.

## Features
- MRIO-based environmental-economic assessments  
- PM2.5 health impact modeling across global trade networks  
- Computational optimizations for large-scale analysis
