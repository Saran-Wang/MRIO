# 🌍 Analysis Code for *“International (Fair) Trade in Air-Quality-Related Mortality”*

This repository contains the full Python workflow used in the paper **“International (Fair) Trade in Air-Quality-Related Mortality.”**  
The project integrates the **InMAP atmospheric model** with **multi-regional input–output (MRIO)** frameworks (GTAP and EORA datasets) to quantify **country-level production- and consumption-based PM₂.₅ concentrations, health impacts, and economic externalities** associated with international trade.

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

The computational environment for InMAP simulations can be set up following the official repository:  
👉 [https://github.com/spatialmodel/inmap](https://github.com/spatialmodel/inmap)

All analysis codes here are written in **Python**, with required packages listed at the beginning of each notebook.  
The project assumes that InMAP simulations have already been run and the resulting **country-specific concentration outputs** are available as inputs for subsequent analysis.
