# üåç Analysis Code for *‚ÄúInternational (Fair) Trade in Air-Quality-Related Mortality‚Äù*

This repository contains the full Python workflow used in the paper **‚ÄúInternational (Fair) Trade in Air-Quality-Related Mortality.‚Äù**  
The project integrates the **InMAP atmospheric model** with **multi-regional input‚Äìoutput (MRIO)** frameworks (GTAP and EORA datasets) to quantify **country-level production- and consumption-based PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ concentrations, health impacts, and economic externalities** associated with international trade.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

The computational environment for InMAP simulations can be set up following the official repository:  
üëâ [https://github.com/spatialmodel/inmap](https://github.com/spatialmodel/inmap)

All analysis codes here are written in **Python**, with required packages listed at the beginning of each notebook.  
The project assumes that InMAP simulations have already been run and the resulting **country-specific concentration outputs** are available as inputs for subsequent analysis.

## üß± Repository Overview

The repository is structured into six main folders, corresponding to the major stages of the analysis pipeline:

| Folder | Purpose |
|:-------|:---------|
| `1_Country_Emission` | Prepare inputs for InMAP simulations and generate country-specific emission maps. |
